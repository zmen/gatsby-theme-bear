# JavaScript

**JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight, interpreted, or [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) compiled programming language with [first-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function) functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many [non-browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_Web_pages) environments also use it, such as [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](Apache CouchDB) and [Adobe Acrobat](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html). JavaScript is a [prototype-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prototype-based_programming), multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more [about JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript).

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.

The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.

Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have a very different syntax, semantic, and use.
